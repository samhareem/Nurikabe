The Nurikabe, Reader and Board classes were tested automatically using JUnit. In addition, PIT was used for mutation testing. The objective was to test the functionality of all public methods with valid input. Some of the methods (for example Reader.readFile) was also tested with invalid input to confirm error handling. An overall line coverage of 89% and a mutation coverage of 74% was achieved. No bugs were encountered by automatic testing with version 1.0 of the program.

The graphic user interface of the program was not tested automatically, but by hand. The operator went through as many situations as possible, such as multiple starts, resets, and exits of levels in different states of completion. No bugs were encountered during this process. The UI was also tested for responsiveness, with no problems being detected with performance.
